For those who play Valheim, I've compiled a modpack for the r2modmanager with some very useful mods, along with my configurations for said mods.

5. Download the nexus .zip for the corresponding pack version
6. Extract the .zip somewhere
7. Under the 'Mod' category in the sidebar, select 'Installed'
8. Drag and drop the extracted zipped mods, one by one, into the r2modmanager window
